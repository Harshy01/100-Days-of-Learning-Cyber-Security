So there are these .srt files in every section of the course, i just got 
curious to find out what these files are and then i opened one of them and 
found out that these are Subtitle files with the format as:

<<Subtitle Number>>
<<Starting Time Hours:Minutes:Seconds>>,<<Some 3 digit numbers i.e mili seconds>> --> <<End Time Hours:Minutes:Seconds>>,<<Some 3 digit Numbers i.e mili Seconds>>
<<Content(Actual Subtitle)>>
<<one line gap>>

Source: https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/srt-file --> An SRT file 
(otherwise known as SubRip(SubRip is a 
software used to extract files subtitles from video with timestamps and 
create .srt file) Subtitle file) is a plain text file that holds critical 
information about the subtitles of a video including start and end time of 
your text to ensure that subtitle match your audio and the sequential 
number of your subtitle
It is good to note that the .srt files are just plain text files and does 
not contain any video or audio data
How to create a *.srt File:
	You can create a .srt file using any text editor including nano, vim, notepad++, TextEdit.
	Open your text editor and order each line of your Subtitle starting with 1
	From the next line put the time the subtitle begins and then "-->" and then add the time when it ends in the format "hours:minutes:seconds,miliseconds"
	Below your start and end timestamp add the text you want to show in the video
	save the file as <<filename>>.srt, then You're ready to go.

Thinking about the .srt files it just came to my mind that we can exploit 
or maybe find a vulnerability in the way how the video player reads the 
.srt files , for that we should know how that actually works, i researched 
about that but did not found a thing on how does the .srt file get 
interpreted by the video player but i think we could find something there
