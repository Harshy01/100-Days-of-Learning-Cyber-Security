Why pentesting ?
This is a Question you should ask yourself and the answer could be 
different for everyone and it's okay to have an answer different from 
other you should just have a will to learn and to implement what you 
learn, in my 100 days of learning cybersecurity i will mostly focus on 
learning most of the Practical Ethical Hacking part and make me as well as 
you familiar with that, for me the reasons are as follows:
1.I Love Cyber Security, i mean since i was a child i was always keen to 
learn about new technologies that disrupted the market and when i used to 
learn about these Tech i became aware of Breaking into these tech stacks.
2.There are flexible Working time, atleast the place where i work , you 
can work from home and save a lot of travelling time
3.The salaries are really high, due to the high demand in the market and 
sortage of people The payscale is really high.
4.This type of jobs has a good work life balance, or atlest you can manage 
the time here more than other places.
5.If you love learning and willing to learning everyday this is going to 
feel mentally soothing after being in this feild because there is 
literally a lot to learn and believe me you're gonna love it.


A Day In Life


Roll out of bed

You will just get out of bed and get yourself ready for work as you like 
you can be completely naked doing work or well dressed doing work , 
dose'nt really matter as you will mostly be working from home , you will 
mostly do something to keep yourself fit and give some family time.


External/Internal Network

External

By external assessment what i mean is that you will be Somewhere around 
the world and doing a network assessment and looking the network from 
outside and will try to get inside the network

Internal

After you have breached the network got an RCE(Remote Code 
Execution) 
There comes the Part where you find what can you do when you're inside the 
network , This is mostly cover the Active Directory Pentest and Dropbox 
and Vpn key
These 100 days will mostly based upon these internal and external network assessment , you


Web Application

This includes Assessing a website and you need to find out weater you can 
break that website find admin credentials or get somewhere you 
Should'nt get to, This also includes OWASP Top 10(This include a lot of 
Bug Bounty Stuff)


Wireless

This is just the evaluation of wireless network and see weather you can 
breach that network and and see that weather a guest is able to sign in to 
the company's wifi network, and that should not happen but it happens in 
most of the cases


Physical/Social/Phishing/Vishing
This includes breaking into a building or going to a place where they 
do'nt want you to go, using some social skills to bypass some people 
copying some scan ids cloning badges to access network area and doing 
Phishing for some Credentials 


SOC("Purple Teaming")

A penetration Tester or an Ethical Hacker is often known as red and a 
defender is often known as blue so when you mix red and blue it becomes 
purple so purple teaming is like a cat and mouse game where both blue team 
and red team sits together and go on a war , i mean literally red team 
attacks the network and blue team protects it and they find the way to 
breakin and protect the network, having a motive of finally protecting and 
fixing the vulneriblities in the system


Report Writing

So After you're done with all of the above things you come to the report 
writting and believe me this is an important part of your job and most of 
you would find this boring to do but it is important to express and show 
the severiety of issue you have solved in order to get Paid more and fix 
the vulenariblity


Debrief

So this is where you take your report and show that to a client and walk 
him thorough what did you do and what kind of vulneriblities did you find 
and you should be ready to answer the Three questions that are:
What is Wrong?
Why it's Wrong?
How Can we fix that?
